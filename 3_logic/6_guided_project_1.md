# Guided Project - Develop Conditional Branching and Looping Structures in C#

- This project came with starter code the learner has to complete
- The tasks to complete are:
    - Sample data: convert the if-elseif-else structure to switch-case structure that improves readability.
    - Menu loop: enclose the main menu and menu item selection in a loop that iterates until the user enters "exit".
    - Menu selections: write the code for a switch-case structure that establishes separate code branches for each menu option.
    - Code branches: write placeholder within the menu item branches that provides user feedback until app features are developed.
    - Verification test: perform verification tests for the code that you develop in this exercise.
